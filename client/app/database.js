On the other hand, many computer systems don't perform nearly as well as Google - hence the now-clich√© \"the system is down.\" In this class, we study the scientific principles behind the construction of high-performance, scalable systems. The course begins with a discussion of C language, and moves up the stack from there to the features of modern architectures, assembly languages, and operating system services such as I/O and synchronization.",
